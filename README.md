# Average Web Site

I made a repo to build a typical news website that serves useless JavaScript.

Facebook and Apple are now in the business of delivering native articles to their users.  Why?  It isn't because the content is better, or the web is slower.  It is because we are ruining our sites with needless JavaScript.

The average news website will bombard the user with needless marketing tags, share buttons, modal sign up forms, interstitial ads, etc.  Users just want to read the content, but we're not giving that to them.

Native isn't beating the web, it's beating us.

===================================
Built with Yeoman Webapp-Generator.

```bash
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```
